    Q1 What are basic concepts of OOP explain each in detail
    An
    s
    Encapsulation and Data abstraction: Wrapping up(combing) of data and functions into a single
    unit is known as encapsulation. The data is not accessible to the outside world and only those
    functions which are wrapping in the class can access it. This insulation of the data from direct
    access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding.
    Data abstraction refers to, providing only needed information to the outside world and hiding
    implementation details. Functions of the class are available to user but its implementation part is
    not available to user.
    Inheritance: inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of
    objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. Inheritance provides
    re usability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying
    it.
    Polymorphism: polymorphism means ability to take more than one form. An operation may
    exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data
    used in the operation.
    C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.
    The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as
    operator overloading.
    Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks.
    Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.
    Dynamic Binding: In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is
    decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support this.
    Message Passing: Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information
    to each other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will
    invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing
    involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the information to be
    sent.
    Q2 Differentiate between procedure oriented and OOP Paradigm
    Basis For comparison POP OOP
    Basic Procedure/Structure oriented . Object oriented.
    Approach Top-down. Bottom-up.
    Basis
    Main focus is on "how to get the
    task done" i.e. on the procedure
    or structure of a program .
    Main focus is on 'data security'. Hence, only objects
    are permitted to access the entities of a class.
    Division
    Large program is divided into units
    called functions.
    Entire program is divided into objects.
    Entity accessing mode No access specifier observed. Access specifier are "public", "private", "protected".
    1
    Overloading/Polymorphism
    Neither it overload functions nor
    operators.
    It overloads functions, constructors, and operators.
    Inheritance
    Their is no provision of
    inheritance.
    Inheritance achieved in three modes public private
    and protected.
    Data hiding & security
    There is no proper way of hiding
    the data, so data is insecure
    Data is hidden in three modes public, private, and
    protected. hence data security increases.
    Data sharing
    Global data is shared among the
    functions in the program.
    Data is shared among the objects through the
    member functions.
    Friend functions/classes No concept of friend function.
    Classes or function can become a friend of another
    class with the keyword "friend".
    Note: "friend" keyword is used only in c++
    Virtual classes/ function No concept of virtual classes .
    Concept of virtual function appear during
    inheritance.
    Example C, VB, FORTRAN, Pascal C++, JAVA, VB.NET, C#.NET.
    Q3 What are benefits and applications of OOP?
    Applications and Benefits of using OOP
    Applications of using OOP:
     User interface design such as windows, menu ,…
     Real Time Systems
     Simulation and Modeling
     Object oriented databases
     AI and Expert System
     Neural Networks and parallel programming
     Decision support and office automation system etc
    Benefits of OOP
    The main advantages are
     It is easy to model a real system as real objects are represented by programming objects
    in OOP. The objects are processed by their member data and functions. It is easy to
    analyze the user requirements.
     With the help of inheritance, we can reuse the existing class to derive a new class such
    that the redundant code is eliminated and the use of existing class is extended. This saves
    time and cost of program.
     In OOP, data can be made private to a class such that only member functions of the class
    can access the data. This principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build a secure
    program that can not be invaded by code in other part of the program.
     With the help of polymorphism, the same function or same operator can be used for
    different purposes. This helps to manage software complexity easily.
     Large problems can be reduced to smaller and more manageable problems. It is easy to
    partition the work in a project based on objects.
     It is possible to have multiple instances of an object to co-exist without any interference
    i.e. each object has its own separate member data and function.
     you mean by keywords, identifiers, Variables, Operators, Manipulator? Explain
